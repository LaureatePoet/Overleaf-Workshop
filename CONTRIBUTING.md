# Contributing to Overleaf Workshop
The Overleaf Workshop extension is an open source project and we welcome contributions of all kinds from the community.
There are many ways to contribute, from improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into the extension itself.

In this document, we will mainly elaborate on how to make code contributions to the project.
